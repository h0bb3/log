## 5 Services to the department, faculty, and university
During the revision period, my involvement in administration/other was 15 % (on average).
List your engagements below and motivate why these should are important to consider when appraising your work performance.

## 6 Other information
Provide any additional information that you think is important to knowwhen appraising your work performance, such as extended sick leaves, parent leave, engagements that
took significant time, etc. If you think that your salary is incorrect, for example, compared to your peers, please note that here and motivate why. Be as specific as possible.

In general I think I put a lot of effort and time into my work. During spring 2023 I took over the responsibility of several new courses. This generated 135h of sheduled overtime - while I'm happy to work hard for the benefit of the University I'm not happy to do so without due compensation. There also seems to be a gidlock in handling external funding - you should get external funding for research but you also need to make sure your "have the time" and no new employees means that there can basocally never be any serious research applications unless you are not teaching.
