## 5 Services to the department, faculty, and university
During the revision period, my involvement in administration/other was 0 % (on average).
List your engagements below and motivate why these should are important to consider when appraising your work performance.

## 6 Other information
Provide any additional information that you think is important to knowwhen appraising your work performance, such as extended sick leaves, parent leave, engagements that
took significant time, etc. If you think that your salary is incorrect, for example, compared to your peers, please note that here and motivate why. Be as specific as possible.

I find my salary to low for the engagement I put into my work. For example, being hired as an administrator (informatör) for a few years has higher salary. I have been at the university for 20 years now and I'm basically payed below median and average salary among peers at the deparment and has been for several years. I think I deserve at least an average pay among peers, if not higher consirering my experience. I will not accept a minimum wage and I'm considering moving into industry if things do not improve..
