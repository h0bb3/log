Finally, [my open source project](https://github.com/tobias-dv-lnu/s4rdm3x) has been accepted for publication in the [Journal of Open Souce Software](https://joss.theoj.org/). Actually kind of proud as it has been a number of years of work resulting in that code. So it was nice that it was accepted. One interesting aspect is the flow of working with the review process as a Github issue. This was also supported by a bot that did a lot of the administrative tasks. Good stuff.
Besides being stored on GitHub the code is also archived as CERN for as long as CERN exists. Kind of cool.

The actual paper is named [s4rdm3x: A Tool Suite to Explore Code to Architecture Mapping Techniques](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02791) and published under open access.

Now I need to merge 6 months of development into the master branch and get a new release out there :D

On Monday we will release the assignment with our Gradle and GitLab build pipeline. There are quite a few steps that need to work out for almost 200 students so I hope it will not be a total disaster...
